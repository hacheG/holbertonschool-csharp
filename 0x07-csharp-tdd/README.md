C# Tasks
Allowed editors: Visual Studio Code
All files will be compiled on Ubuntu 14.04 LTS using dotnet
A README.md file, at the root of the folder of the project, is mandatory
All default C# files named Program.cs should be renamed to the name given in each task
You do not need to know about namespaces and classes yet. Namespaces should be omitted in this project. The default names generated in Program.cs for class are okay
Each C# task requires its own folder and .csproj file. Push all task folders to your Github and ensure the task names on the folders are correct
You do not need to push your obj/ or bin/ folders
